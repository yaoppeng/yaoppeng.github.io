My name is Yaopeng Peng (彭耀鹏), and I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My advisor is Prof. [Danny Z. Chen](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/danny-chen/). I have more than 10 years of coding experience and have worked on projects involving natural image classification, medical image classification, and segmentation.

My research focuses on developing efficient deep learning algorithms for improved medical image classification and segmentation, which includes data-efficient learning and computation-efficient learning methods. I have also been involved in projects related to natural image processing.
